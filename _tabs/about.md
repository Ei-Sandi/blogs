Hello, I’m Sandi — a developer-in-progress and a firm believer that learning never really stops. As a final-year Computer Science student, I spend a lot of my time learning new technologies, from machine learning to backend systems and experimenting with cloud technologies, and trying to understand how things really work under the hood.

This blog is my way of documenting the journey — the successes, the mistakes, and the lessons that stick with me. I see writing as part of the learning process: by explaining something clearly, I understand it more deeply.

Right now, I’m exploring areas like machine learning, backend performance, distributed systems, and cloud-native development. A year from now, I’ll probably be chasing something new — and that’s exactly what excites me about this field.

If you’re also curious, learning, and building, I hope you’ll find something useful here — or at least a reminder that we’re all figuring it out as we go.
